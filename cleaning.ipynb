    "The spidering and data handling is in spiderlings.ipynb, this one is for cleaning up the data and normalzing the JSON format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I put this all in a notebook is that I expect a lot of the stuff to vary wildly from file to file. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is that I didn't do a good job of keeping it clean when I was developing the spiders over the course of multiple years of development. The other reason is that the datasets themselves admitted different levels of parsing. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a first pass, I want to clean up ingredients. I'm going to want to normalize a couple of different aspects of the representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All liquids in the same units\n",
    "    - Might be centiliters\n",
    "    - dashes, barspoons, etc. need conversion\n",
    "- All names of cocktails in title case (Gin Martini, not GIN MARTINI)\n",
    "- Cocktials with matching names assigned a unique ID as well (Martini-01, etc.)\n",
    "- Ingredients normalized so largest amount is 1, others proportional to that\n",
    "    - Not so they sum to one, that loses relative scale\n",
    "- Some way of handling garnishes and muddled ingredients\n",
    "    - Eggs, muddled ingredients tend to get counted rather than measured. \n",
    "- Language modeling to normalize instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "For no reason other than that I picked it at random, I'm going for the Martha Stewart data first. The file is, unfortunately, not well-formatted JSON, because I created it... fuuuuck. 4 years ago. Time flies. \n",

    "Anyway, issue one is that the data is, for each line in the file, a JSON dictionary of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"name\": \"Strawberry-Cucumber Gin-Elderflower Spritz\", \"ingredients\": [\"12 strawberries, hulled and sliced (1 1/4 cups), plus whole berries for serving\", \"12 thin cucumber slices, halved (3/4 cup), plus whole rounds for serving\", \"2 tablespoons superfine sugar\", \"3 ounces fresh lemon juice\", \"9 ounces gin, such as Citadelle, chilled\", \"6 ounces St-Germain, chilled\", \"Club soda, chilled; and Peychaud's bitters, for serving\"], \"instructions\": [\"Muddle sliced strawberries, halved cucumber slices, sugar, and lemon juice in the bottom of a pitcher until fruits break down and release most of their juices and sugar has dissolved. Stir in gin and St-Germain to combine. Fill 6 glasses halfway with ice. Divide fruit-and-gin mixture evenly among glasses. Top each with 1 to 2 ounces club soda; stir once.
