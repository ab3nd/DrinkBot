    "The spidering and data handling is in spiderlings.ipynb, this one is for cleaning up the data and normalzing the JSON format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I put this all in a notebook is that I expect a lot of the stuff to vary wildly from file to file. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is that I didn't do a good job of keeping it clean when I was developing the spiders over the course of multiple years of development. The other reason is that the datasets themselves admitted different levels of parsing. \n",

    "\n",
    "- All liquids in the same units\n",
    "    - Might be centiliters\n",
    "    - dashes, barspoons, etc. need conversion\n",
    "- All names of cocktails in title case (Gin Martini, not GIN MARTINI)\n",
    "- Cocktials with matching names assigned a unique ID as well (Martini-01, etc.)\n",
    "- Ingredients normalized so largest amount is 1, others proportional to that\n",
    "    - Not so they sum to one, that loses relative scale\n",
    "- Some way of handling garnishes and muddled ingredients\n",
    "    - Eggs, muddled ingredients tend to get counted rather than measured. \n",
    "- Language modeling to normalize instructions\n",

Stir in gin and St-Germain to combine. Fill 6 glasses halfway with ice. Divide fruit-and-gin mixture evenly among glasses. Top each with 1 to 2 ounces club soda; stir once.
