Some exploratory stuff:
- How many units are currently in use in the data, and how do they break down
  in terms of frequency relative to the whole set?
- How many ingredients are there? 
    - Is there tooling to support building ontologies of this stuff in a 
      reasonable way? Kind of like the Discovery of Grounded Theory, but with
      at least a little automation support?
    - How do the ingredients break down in terms of liquors, mixers, bitters, 
      other stuff that gets put in. 

Also want a concordance of similar flavors (Strega is like a sweet chartreuse)
and a hierarchy of abstraction (Laphroaig is a Islay is a scotch). This is 
called an ontology.

Entries are titled with the name of the cocktail, then ingredients, then 
instructions, then a picture

Next page link is of the form https://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2025-01-27T08:00:00-05:00&max-results=9
but you can set the "max-results" to at least 90, but putting it to 900 doesn't
pull down the entire blog. 

<div class='post-body entry-content'> contains the recipe, but the formatting is 
just <br> tags until you get to the image. The last line before the image is the
instructions. I'll probably have to do the parse in a pretty loose way and then 
go through and find the stuff with nonsense ingredients.

Each page has links to "recent additions", and the links are all of the form
https://kindredcocktails.com/cocktail/ followed by some name, so they can be
filtered pretty easily. 

The real attack vector here is the ingredients pages. https://kindredcocktails.com/info/ingredients
has an alphabetical list of ingredients pages. Hit all the ingredient pages, 
which have URLs like https://kindredcocktails.com/ingredient/allspice. Then 
find the cocktails on those, especially the link to "Explore more (Ingredient 
name) cocktails.". That page has more cocktails on it, and is paginated, so it's 
https://kindredcocktails.com/cocktail?scope=0&ingredient%5B0%5D=Gin and then 
https://kindredcocktails.com/cocktail?scope=0&ingredient%5B0%5D=Gin&page=5 to 
get subsequent pages.
